This is a personal project I've been recently working on. I'm designing a 5V to 3.3V LDO using the Cadence GPDK, which takes in a noisy power input and outputs a steady DC voltage. LDOs are a fundamental block of analog IC design and see frequent use in providing stable power to other circuits on-chip. Circuit schematics, layouts, and specs are shown below.
