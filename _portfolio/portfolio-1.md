For my Embedded Systems final project, I created a reaction time tester using the Freedom KL25Z Microcontroller. Using the touch screen on the board, the user would touch the side of the screen corresponding to the LED color being flashed (green or blue) as quickly as possible. The time would then be displayed on screen. The code is split up into several states akin to a finite state machine, with states for initialization, waiting for the user to tap the screen, printing out the result, and setup for the next attempt. A video showcasing the reaction time tester is shown below.
