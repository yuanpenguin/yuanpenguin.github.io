For my senior capstone at Binghamton, my team created a network of swarm robots capable of mapping out an enclosed 2D space. Each robot traverses said space with LiDAR sensors to map out the terrain and output the data to one computer, which shows the combined location data of every robot. This project has applications for scanning unknown areas too dangerous or inconvenient for humans to traverse. The software utilized ROS libraries and Python scripts to efficiently search and scan the area. This project was sponsored by Lockheed Martin, who plans to utilize and improve upon this work for searching and rescuing applications.
