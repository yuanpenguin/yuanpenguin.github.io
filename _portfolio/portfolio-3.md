At CMU, I worked as a research assistant in Prof. Rick Carley's lab doing design in analog circuits and passive components. I collaborated in a team of 6 to create an FMR nanoparticle measurement lab-on-chip interferometer in the TSMC 28nm process. This project enables measurements of nanoparticles at higher SNR than current methods, which has applications for research on future memory technologies. For this project, I designed and laid out a class AB pseudo-differential output buffer. Circuit schematics are shown below. I also designed a high quality factor RF inductor shown below for the Skywater 130nm process, which does not have inductor models.
