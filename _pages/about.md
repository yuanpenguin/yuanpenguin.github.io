My name is Yuanpeng, and I'm an electrical engineer. My interests include circuit design, particuarly analog, and machine learning. I received my MS in ECE from Carnegie Mellon University in 2025 where I primarily conducted research in these fields under Prof. [Rick Carley](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/carley-rick.html) and Prof. [David Allstot](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275544000). During my time at CMU, I also interned at Apple in the summer of 2024 working on RF hardware. Before my MS, I got my BS in computer engineering from Binghamton University in 2023. I'm currently looking for a full-time role, so feel free to check out my [portfolio](https://yuanpenguin.github.io/portfolio/) and [resume](https://yuanpenguin.github.io/cv/) as well as connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuanpeng-zhang/)!
