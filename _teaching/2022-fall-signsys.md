Signals and Systems
======
An introductory course on signals and systems. Students learn about the basic mathematics of signals and linear systems, continuous and discrete time Fourier analysis, Z transforms, and Laplace transforms. The course culminates in a final project in which students use signal processing techniques to extract hidden signals from a given input signal in MATLAB. Course info can be found on Prof Fowler's website [here](https://ws.binghamton.edu/Fowler/Fowler%20Personal%20Page/EECE301%20-%20Flipped.htm).
