Analog Integrated Circuit Design
======
A project-based graduate course on analog integrated circuit design. Students learn about the methodologies and techniques for designing analog integrated circuits and systems. Topics covered include circuit level-analysis such as MOSFET operation characteristics, large and small signal models, and analysis of elementary circuit blocks as well as design methodologies such as gm/id design, high frequency, feedback, and noise analysis. Throughout the course, students are given design projects where they design their own circuits such as a transimpedance amplifier, operational amplifier, and comparator in Cadence Virtuoso to pass performance specifications. They then learn to lay out their finished circuits. Course info can be found [here](https://courses.ece.cmu.edu/18623).
